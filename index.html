        <p>As the title states, I implore the reader to ponder the state of the universe upon its death.</p> 
        
        <p>The heat death of the universe is a concept that is extremely terrifying, proposing that some day due to dark matter and the constant expansion of the universe, all matter will be so spread out that nothing will ever happen again. </p>
        
        <p>
           While this might seem like the end of all things, theres an alternative theory, the big bounce, where gravity wins instead and the universe collapses in on itself in such a manner that the big bang is recreated and a new universe born, a much more soothing outcome.

            Hello my wonderful readers, and today, we gonna be talking 'bout embracing the darkness within us all. The "intrusive" thoughts. One of the most famous ones, from Youtuber and streamer Markiplier, is: <br><br>
            "But what if I don't run? What if I'm not afraid anymore? What if  I want them to get me? what if i want them to try?"
            </p>
